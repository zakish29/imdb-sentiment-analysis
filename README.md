# Introduction

The use of sentiment analysis in natural language processing (NLP) has become increasingly popular in recent years. It is a technique that involves the automatic identification and classification of subjective information present in text data, including opinions, attitudes, emotions, and other related sentiments. In this project, we will be exploring the IMDB movie review dataset, which contains information on reviews of movies, TV shows, and other related content. We will be using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for sentiment analysis in NLP to predict the sentiment of the reviews.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to apply sentiment analysis to the IMDB movie review dataset using an ANN model in NLP. The specific goals of the project are as follows:

- To preprocess and clean the text data to prepare it for analysis
- To train an ANN model using the preprocessed data to predict the sentiment of reviews
- To evaluate the performance of the model and compare it with other models
- To analyze the results and draw conclusions about the sentiment of the reviews and the effectiveness of the model
